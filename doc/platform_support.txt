Some details in this module are heavily OS, compiler or even platform
dependent. These include:
- High precision time measurement procedures
- The procedures that trick the compiler optimizer doNotOptimizeAway() and
  memoryClobber()
This module has been tested on:
- Windows 10/x86-64 with the MSVC compiler (also called vcc sometimes)

Porting to other platforms is not too much work, but it must be done
correctly. This means that the resulting assembly code must be checked, to
determine for example if the doNotOptimizeAway() works and does not generate
unnecessary overhead.

Everyone is welcome to help / contribute with the porting job. Inspiration
can be found on many sources on the internet, some of which are listed in the
introduction.
